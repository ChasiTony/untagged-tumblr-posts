  <h1>About the site</h1>

  <p>
    The idea for this site started in 2013, when a friend was trying to go back and retag her old Tumblr posts.
    Without a way to easily see all her untagged posts, it was impossible for her to be sure that she was done.
    I wrote her <a href="http://alexwlchan.net/2013/08/untagged-tumblr-posts/">a Python script</a>, and that was that.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2014, I noticed I was getting a lot of hits to this blog post, but a Python script isn’t very user friendly.
    I wrote this site to be an easier way to get a list of your untagged posts, because clearly it was something people wanted.

  <p>
    It's been through a number of iterations &ndash; previously it was written in Angular, then a client-side JavaScript app.
    The current iteration is a Flask app, served through UWSGI and nginx, and hosted on <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=ba2e6ce21e0c63952a7c74967ea0b96617bd44a3">Linode</a>.
