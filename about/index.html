Without a way to easily see all her untagged posts, it was impossible for her to be sure that she was done. I wrote her <a href=http://alexwlchan.net/2013/08/untagged-tumblr-posts/ >a Python script</a> to get the job done, and that was that. </p><p> In 2014, I was getting a lot of hits to that script, but a Python script isn’t very user friendly. I wrote this site to be an easier way to get a list of your untagged posts, because clearly it was something people wanted. </p><p> The app is implemented in JavaScript, and the source code is <a href=https://github.com/alexwlchan/untagged-tumblr-posts>on GitHub</a>. The code is released under the <a href=http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>MIT license</a>. The site is hosted with <a href=https://pages.github.com>GitHub Pages</a>. </p><h2>About me</h2><p>Hi, I’m Alex! I’d include a picture, but I’m photo shy.</p><p> I’m a software developer. In my day job, I work on <a href=http://www.projectcalico.org>Project Calico</a> for <a href=http://www.metaswitch.com>Metaswitch Networks</a>. By night, I blog about programming – among other things – at <a href=http://alexwlchan.net>alexwlchan.net</a> (although the posting schedule is quite sporadic). My blog includes scripts like this one – small things that I find useful or interesting. </p><p> Shockingly, for somebody who makes a site about Tumblr, I spend a lot of free time on Tumblr. Look for <a href=http://alexwlchan.tumblr.com>alexwlchan</a>, but don’t expect much in the way of posts – I’m more of a lurker. </p></article><hr class=footer></main><footer><p>Not affiliated with nor endorsed by Tumblr.
