<h2>About the site</h2>

<p>
    The idea for this site started in 2013, when a friend was trying to go back and retag her old Tumblr posts. Without a way to easily see all her untagged posts, it was impossible for her to be sure that she was done. I wrote her <a href="http://alexwlchan.net/2013/08/untagged-tumblr-posts/">a Python script</a> to get the job done, and that was that.
</p>

<p>
    In 2014, I was getting a lot of hits to that script, but a Python script isn’t very user friendly. I wrote this site to be an easier way to get a list of your untagged posts, because clearly it was something people wanted.
</p>

<p>
    The app is implemented in JavaScript, and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/alexwlchan/untagged-tumblr-posts">on GitHub</a>. The code is released under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>. The site is hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Hi, I’m Alex! I’d include a picture, but I’m photo shy.</p>

<p>
    I’m a software developer. In my day job, I work on <a href="http://www.projectcalico.org">Project Calico</a> for <a href="http://www.metaswitch.com">Metaswitch Networks</a>. By night, I blog about programming – among other things – at <a href="http://alexwlchan.net">alexwlchan.net</a> (although the posting schedule is quite sporadic). My blog includes scripts like this one – small things that I find useful or interesting.
</p>

<p>
    Shockingly, for somebody who makes a site about Tumblr, I spend a lot of free time on Tumblr. Look for <a href="http://alexwlchan.tumblr.com">alexwlchan</a>, but don’t expect much in the way of posts – I’m more of a lurker.
